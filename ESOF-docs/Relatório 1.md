The purpose of Terasology is to research procedural terrain generation and efficient rendering techniques in Java.

The game consists in a very large and procedurally generated world made of blocks. These blocks can represent different materials or objects such as dirt, stone, wood, trees, grass, sans, etc. The user controls a player, moving around in the world trying to survive wild creatures and find rare materials.

As far as the repository can tell the project dates back to February 2011 and has a total of 63 contributors, even though only 16 have been active this year. The creator of the project is Benjamin Glatzel (begla) who is joined by 3 other users ("immortius", "Cervator", "msteiger") as the project's main developers with over 2300 combined commits to the repository.
